This script was written to aid in finding more DuQu drivers. The more drivers that are detected, the more we can find more about it. 
All we ask for is that people collaborate and share the samples the tool will find on their computer to us and other researchers.

Usage: python DuquDriverPatterns.py [Directory you want to scan]

example: python DuquDriverPatterns.py ./directoryOfMalware

If you find something cool, put it up on something like filehosting, filedropper, rapidshare, etc.  
and send us the link at:
unhandduqulikeitshot@gmail.com

or

message us here and we'll find the links.

Thanks to EoD for submitting a Python3 compatible changes.
